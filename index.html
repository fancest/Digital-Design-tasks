                <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a> (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning
                    and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web
                    page's.<br><br> (These are: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS"
                        target="_blank">CSS</a> and <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference">JavaScript)</a><br><br>
                        "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

                <h2 class="grid-header">The Great Pair</h2>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document
                    written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how
                    elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.<br><br>

                    CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C specifications</a>. Previously, development of
                    various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed versioning of the latest
                    recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never become an
                    official version.<br><br>
                    But you can use global attribute <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/style"
                        target="_blank">"style"</a> anytime you want to sketch your tags right inside 'em, so you won't
                    need to create new document .css and connect it with .html doc in head tag.

                <h2 class="grid-header">Where The Coding Begins</h2>
                <p>The thing is we need to code every mechanic and feature on our website page. We can't actually do
                    that by using only HTML and CSS simply since these are not programming languages.<br><br>
                    There comes JavaScript. With JavaScript we can actually "play" with our HTML tags and properties
                    using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML"
                        target="_blank">this bad boy</a><br><br>
                    Sometimes it's actually usefull! Without this property it just overweights your HTML "code".

                <h2 class="grid-header">HTML Grammar</h2>
                <p>In programming, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics"
                        target="_blank">Semantics</a> refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what
                    effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element
                    have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)<br><br>
                    This will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no semantic value, so it will not
                    get any extra benefits as described above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element
                    for the right job.<br><br>

                    HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default
                    presentation styling. Presentation (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of CSS.<br><br>

                    At least I tried, tho.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is useful if you want to become a web developer. Beyond
                    mechanical use, it's important to learn how to use these technologies responsibly so that all
                    readers might use your creations on the web. To help you achieve this, this module will cover
                    general best practices (which are demonstrated throughout the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript topics),
                    cross browser testing, and some tips on enforcing accessibility from the start. <br><br>
                    By default, HTML is accessible, if used correctly. Web accessibility involves ensuring that content
                    remains accessible, regardless of who and how the web is accessed.<br><br>
                    The Firefox Accessibility Inspector is a very useful tool for checking out accessibility issues on
                    web pages.<br><br>
                    We need the thing above to help outer "trackers" to read our page properly.<br><br>
                    Also accessibility collaborates with semantics.
